## hla22-sharding Sharding

1) Create 3 docker containers: postgresql-b, postgresql-b1, postgresql-b2
2) Setup horizontal/vertical sharding as itâ€™s described in this lesson and with alternative tool ( citus, pgpool-|| etc )
3) Insert 1 000 000 rows into books
4) Measure performance for reads and writes
5) Do the same without sharding
6) Compare performance of 3 cases ( without sharding, FDW, and approach of your choice )

## Setup

All three cases are described under [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file. Test script is implemented in python and
 located under [main.py](./main.py). Initialization scripts are located under [sql](./sql) folder. 
                
## Results
Since sharding is implemented on one machine, the case without sharding has best results.
Citus performed best for data insertion, FWD performed better for data query.
