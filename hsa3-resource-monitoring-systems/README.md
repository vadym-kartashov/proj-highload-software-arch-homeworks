## Highload architecture 3 homework

### Requirements
Java 17 (to build java sample app)

### Building project and deploying to docker:
Run 'build_and_deploy.sh' script in root directory of project

### Running load on system:
Run 'siege_it.sh 10 1 0' script in root directory of project,
Where 10 is number of concurrent workers, 1 load time in minutes, 0 time between requrests

### Result on local environment
(Load has been generated between 15:17 and 15:27)
* ctop output while running siege ![ctop_output.png](ctop_output.png)
* Telegraph Influx dashboard ![Telegraf Influx dashboard.png](Telegraf%20Influx%20dashboard.png)
* Elasticsearch dashboard ![Elasticsearch dashboard.png](Elasticsearch%20dashboard.png)
* Mongo dashboard ![Mongo dashboard.png](Mongo%20dashboard.png)

### Stress test results (Homework #5)

Run with N concurrent workers (where N in (10,25,50,100)), 5 minute load time, 0 seconds between requests

Command that is used for stress testing: [./siege_it.sh](siege_it.sh) $N 5 0

URLs file is generated through [./prepare_for_siege.sh](prepare_for_siege.sh) command

Example of such file is shown within [random.siege](random.siege) file

Test results: Since CPU has 8 cores, having more concurrent workers  will bring performance degradation.
