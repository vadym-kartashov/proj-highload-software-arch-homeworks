# hla13-queues
## Redis vs Beanstalkd

Set up 3 containers - beanstalkd and redis (rdb and aof)

Write 2 simple scripts: 1st should put message into queue, 2nd should read from queue.

Configure storing to disk,

Ð¡ompare queues performance.

## Implementation 

5 containers have been prepared: 3 for Redis (no persistence, RDB, AOF) and 2 for Beanstalkd (with and without persistence) <br>
Test has been prepared on 50000 records with 4 different concurrency levels (1, 10, 30, 50)
